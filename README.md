# Book Recommendation System

This project demonstrates an advanced machine learning approach to building a personalized book recommendation system using real-world datasets and modern algorithms. It is designed for both beginners and experienced practitioners who want to understand and implement recommendation engines.

## Project Overview

The Book Recommendation System leverages collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to suggest books tailored to user preferences. It uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and similarity measurement. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive recommendation generation
- Pre-trained models for rapid experimentation

## Folder Contents

- `Book_Dataset.csv`: Raw dataset containing book information.
- `Book_Recommend_Dataset.csv`: Processed dataset for recommendations.
- `Book_Recommendation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `main.py`: Main script for running the recommendation engine.
- `knn_model.pickle`: Pre-trained KNN model for fast recommendations.
- `scaler.pickle`: Scaler object for feature normalization.
- `tfidf.pickle`: TF-IDF vectorizer for text feature extraction.
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: Notebook checkpoints for recovery.

## Key Concepts

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends books based on user similarity and historical ratings.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Uses book metadata and descriptions to find similar items.
- **KNN Algorithm:** Identifies nearest neighbors for personalized suggestions.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts text data into numerical features for similarity analysis.
- **Model Serialization:** Pre-trained models are saved for quick loading and inference.
